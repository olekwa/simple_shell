Requirements
        This project consists of designing a C program to serve as a shell interface that accepts user     commands and then executes each command in a separate process.
Simple Shell was built and tested in Ubuntu 14.04 LTS via Vagrant in VirtualBox and compiled with GCC.
Built in
This project was built and development with the help of this programs and OS:
Ubuntu 14.04 LTS - Operating system tester and working.
Vagrant - Managing virtual machine environments
VirtualBox - VirtualBox is a general-purpose full virtualizer for x86 hardware, targeted at server, desktop and embedded use.Many Operating Systems (OS) work on VirtualBox, For Example, NextStep OS can be installed on Virtual Box.
GCC - Compiler version 4.8.4
